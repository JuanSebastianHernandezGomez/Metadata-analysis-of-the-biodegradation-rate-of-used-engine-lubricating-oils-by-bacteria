# Metadata analysis of the biodegradation rate of used engine lubricating oils by bacteria

In this metadata analysis, 63 bacteria were obtained from 28 different studies from which the reaction kinetic constant and half-life values were calculated for each study and used to make a comparison of previous studies of the biodegradation of used engine lubricating oils by bacteria.

The data shown below are extracted from scientific papers published in different journals if you wish to have more information you can see the complete document in the repository of the [Universidad de la Salle](https://ciencia.lasalle.edu.co/biologia/106/).or use the csv file on the repository.
